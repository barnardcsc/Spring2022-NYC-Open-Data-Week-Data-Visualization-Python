# Intro to Data Visualization Using Python (NYC Open Data Week 2022)

## NYC Open Data Week Workshop 2022: Intro to Data Visualization Using Python
Developed by: Pranathi Srirangam (Computing Fellow), Xueqing Ma (Computing Fellow), and ZoÃ« Webb-Mack (CSC Postbacc Fellow). Adapted from NYC Open Data Week Workshop 2021 by previous CSC Postbacc Fellow Katie Brady.

### Workshop description:
This is an introductory workshop on data visualization using Python and NYC public data.  During the workshop, students will work in Python, using data visualization library Altair and data analysis library Pandas, to create basic data visualizations.  We introduce basics of Python, Altair, and Pandas using simple example data before work with an NYC eviction dataset (imported from URL as a JSON object). 

### Workshop flow:
- Warming up with basics of Python: types (strings and numerical), functions, and dictionaries
- Basics of Altair and Pandas working with a simple dictionary dataset: intro to Pandas dataframes; creating a simple chart from a dataframe using Altair; manipulating color
- Working with NYC public data: working with JSON data; manipulating data using Pandas; generating a bar chart using Altair; datatypes in Altair's "encode"
- Building skills: layering plots using Altair; conditional color-coding; adjusting titles and style; remaining questions

### In this repository:
NYC Open Data Week 2022 Student Template (Student Template):
A workbook for students.  Students should make a copy so that they can work directly on their version of this file during the workshop.  Contains some text to guide the flow of the workshop and comments to structure code cells, but minimal pre-written code.
NYC Open Data Week 2022 Instructor Key (Instructor Key):
Identical to the student template, but code cells are complete.  Serves as a key to reference while working through the workshop and typing in your own copy of the student template.
